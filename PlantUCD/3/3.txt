Create a Java program based on the following UML class diagram.

- Each customer has a unique ID and is linked to exactly one account.
- An account owns a shopping cart and orders.
- A customer can register as a web user to be able to buy items online.
- Being a web user is not mandatory for a customer, as purchases can also be made by phone or by ordering from catalogues.
- A web user has a login name which also serves as a unique ID.
- A web user can be in several states - new, active, temporarily blocked, or banned, and is linked to a shopping cart.
- The shopping cart belongs to an account.
- An account owns customer orders.
- A customer may have no orders.
- Customer orders are sorted and unique.
- Each order can refer to several payments, possibly none.
- Every payment has a unique ID and is related to exactly one account.
- Each order has a current order status.
- Both order and shopping cart have line items linked to a specific product.
- Each line item is related to exactly one product.
- A product can be associated with many line items or no item at all.
