In the library management system, an assigned librarian holds the responsibility of overseeing the details of multiple books. Each librarian is identified by their name, address, and mobile number. They possess the capability to update book information, manage book issuance, verify membership statuses, and perform book searches. Books are characterized by the author's name, book title, publication date, and are associated with a specific catalog. These catalogs encompass a variety of books and are divided into two distinct categories: general and reference. The reference books serve as a means to explore and discover additional books.

The system accommodates a variety of members who have the privilege to either request or return books. Every member is characterized by their name, address, and unique membership number. Members are free to request or return multiple books. The membership is further classified into two distinct types: students and faculty members. To enhance operational efficiency, the system equips librarians with multiple alerts. These alerts encompass the date of the alert, the book's title, the due return date, and any associated fines. Librarians are empowered to apply fines, display alerts, send alert, or delete them as needed.
